# 🫧 Abilities Overview (Watercolor Expression)

> The battlefield is a canvas, and the psyche paints its defense.
> Each ability is both a mechanic and a brushstroke — color, breath, and balance in motion.

## 1. Breathe

* **Type:** Automatic, always active
* **Description:** A constant aura of calm that gently damages nearby stressors.
* **Activation:** Always active
* **Base Stats (Agnostic):**
  * Damage: Moderate, scales steadily with upgrades
  * Aura Radius: Medium
  * Scaling: Linear (+10% per level damage, +5% per level radius)
* **Mechanics:**
  * Applies steady, continuous damage to all stressors in range.
  * Stacks additively with base passive aura damage.
  * Serves as the game's stable "heartbeat."
* **Visual Expression:**
  * A **soft circular bloom** of pigment expands and contracts in rhythm with breathing.
  * Colors shift gently between lavender, amber, and cerulean depending on Serenity.
  * Pigment feathers at the edges; drying and rehydrating leave subtle halos.
  * The entire scene subtly pulses — the paper "breathes."
* **Watercolor Techniques:** *Wet-on-wet diffusion, soft-edge blooming, pigment reactivation, rhythmic desaturation.*

## 2. Recenter

* **Type:** Automatic, cooldown-based pulse
* **Description:** A grounding ripple that slows and soothes approaching stressors.
* **Activation:** Every few seconds (moderate cooldown)
* **Base Stats (Agnostic):**
  * Pulse Radius: Expands outward from the center
  * Slow Strength: High (moderate to strong debuff)
  * Duration: Short pulse (a few seconds)
* **Mechanics:**
  * Expanding pulse slows all stressors it touches.
  * Slow effect persists until the target dies.
  * Upgrade scaling increases radius and slow potency.
* **Visual Expression:**
  * A **droplet of pigment landing on wet paper**, rippling outward as translucent waves.
  * Edges branch unpredictably — watercolor "blooms."
  * The ripple slightly lifts older pigment layers, brightening the area.
  * Under Affirm, the ripple becomes a golden tide that merges seamlessly into the existing wash.
* **Watercolor Techniques:** *Backrun/cauliflower textures, ripple diffusion, transparent layering, soft bleed edges.*

## 3. Affirm

* **Type:** Automatic, timed amplifier
* **Description:** A phase of lucidity and light that strengthens all other abilities.
* **Activation:** Duration-based cycle (long cooldown)
* **Base Stats (Agnostic):**
  * Duration: Long active window
  * Cooldown: Long
  * Amplification: Doubles the effect of other abilities at max upgrade
* **Mechanics:**
  * Increases damage, range, and slow potency of all other active abilities.
  * Triggers automatically on cooldown.
* **Visual Expression:**
  * A **golden glaze wash** floods the canvas, unifying all pigment layers.
  * The world's hues blend softly into warmer tones; edges fade and harmonize.
  * As the wash evaporates, faint outlines remain where pigment once pooled.
* **Watercolor Techniques:** *Glazing, transparency modulation, pigment lifting, warm unification layer.*

## 4. Exhale

* **Type:** Automatic, periodic projectile burst
* **Description:** A release of breath — waves of energy ripple outward, damaging and slowing stressors.
* **Activation:** Every short interval (auto-triggers sooner under pressure)
* **Base Stats (Agnostic):**
  * Waves: Several expanding rings
  * Damage: Burst, moderate per hit
  * Slow: Brief and light
  * Cooldown: Medium-short
* **Mechanics:**
  * Emits concentric waves from the center that damage and briefly slow stressors.
  * Each ring travels outward and fades at distance.
  * Early activation if Serenity falls below 50%.
* **Visual Expression:**
  * **Pigment blooms** erupt from the center in successive translucent rings.
  * Each ring begins saturated, then diffuses outward into faint watercolor halos.
  * Pigments separate into grainy textures as they dry; edges fade into the paper.
  * The effect looks like wet paint being rinsed outward with clean water.
* **Watercolor Techniques:** *Wet-on-wet bloom, pigment dispersion, separation granulation, fading halos.*

## 5. Reflect

* **Type:** Reactive, defensive barrier
* **Description:** A protective dome of clarity that turns stress back upon itself.
* **Activation:** Auto-triggers at low Serenity
* **Base Stats (Agnostic):**
  * Duration: Short to medium
  * Reflect Strength: Moderate percentage of attacker's damage or health
  * Cooldown: Long
* **Mechanics:**
  * Creates a barrier that reflects damage back to any stressor making contact.
  * Negates Serenity loss during duration.
* **Visual Expression:**
  * A **film of clean water pooling atop the paper**, shimmering with faint pigment reflections.
  * When stressors touch it, their colors **bleed backward** — mirrored stains that fade into the barrier.
  * The dome subtly shifts hue, absorbing the colors of those who struck it.
  * When it evaporates, it leaves behind a pale watermark ring.
* **Watercolor Techniques:** *Water pooling, pigment backflow, reflection staining, evaporative halos.*

## 6. Mantra

* **Type:** Automatic, sustained beam
* **Description:** A focused line of attention that dissolves a single stressor's presence.
* **Activation:** Every moderate interval
* **Base Stats (Agnostic):**
  * Damage: Sustained single-target DPS
  * Duration: Short channel
  * Cooldown: Moderate
* **Mechanics:**
  * Locks onto the nearest stressor and maintains a damaging beam for a few seconds.
  * Transfers to another target if the first dies mid-channel.
* **Visual Expression:**
  * A **single, deliberate brushstroke of pigment** drawn from center to target.
  * Edges fray slightly; pigment pools at the contact point.
  * The line fades unevenly as it dries, leaving a ghost stroke on the paper.
  * Under Affirm, the stroke glows faintly, as though gilded with metallic watercolor.
* **Watercolor Techniques:** *Dry-on-wet line control, pigment pooling, fading stroke memory.*

## 7. Ground

* **Type:** Automatic, area trap
* **Description:** A patch of stillness that slows and wears down stressors who linger there.
* **Activation:** Every short interval
* **Base Stats (Agnostic):**
  * Damage: Low-over-time
  * Slow: Strong
  * Duration: Moderate
  * Radius: Small, local zone
* **Mechanics:**
  * Creates a grounding field at a random nearby position that slows and damages stressors within it.
  * Only one active field at a time.
* **Visual Expression:**
  * A **spreading watercolor stain** blooms outward, darkest at its center.
  * Pigment gathers and sediments as it "dries," forming a soft-edged pool of calm.
  * Stressors within appear blurred, their edges softened by the opacity of wet pigment.
  * When it fades, it leaves behind a faint discolored patch, like a dried puddle mark.
* **Watercolor Techniques:** *Puddle bloom, sedimentation, diffuse opacity layering.*

## 8. Release

* **Type:** Automatic, ultimate cleanse
* **Description:** A total letting-go — a surge that clears all stressors and restores calm.
* **Activation:** Auto-triggers when Serenity nearly collapses
* **Base Stats (Agnostic):**
  * Damage: Very high (global hit)
  * Cooldown: Long
  * Serenity Restore: Large portion of max
* **Mechanics:**
  * Emits a global wave that clears stressors and replenishes Serenity.
* **Visual Expression:**
  * The **entire canvas floods with clean water**, dissolving all pigment into swirling gradients.
  * Color bleeds mix into muted gray before washing away completely.
  * As the wash clears, new pastel tones reemerge — a freshly painted calm.
  * The visual reset feels like rinsing the mind's palette.
* **Watercolor Techniques:** *Full wash, pigment lifting, rewet-and-drain, tonal reset.*

## 9. Align

* **Type:** Automatic, rhythmic modulator
* **Description:** Alternates between offense and defense phases to maintain equilibrium.
* **Activation:** Always active (continuous cycle)
* **Base Stats (Agnostic):**
  * Cycle: Short repeating period
  * Bonus Strength: Moderate, toggling between damage and control
* **Mechanics:**
  * Alternates focus: boosts Breathe (offense) → boosts Recenter (defense).
  * Phases repeat continuously, creating natural rhythm.
* **Visual Expression:**
  * The aura's **temperature oscillates** between warm and cool tones like glazing layers.
  * Each transition behaves like a wash applied over damp paint — colors bleed softly into each other, forming new intermediate hues.
  * The aura ripples subtly, pigment rehydrating and drying with the rhythm.
* **Watercolor Techniques:** *Temperature contrast, wet-over-damp blending, slow bleed transitions.*

## Design Notes

### Activation Patterns

- **Always Active:** Breathe, Align
- **Cooldown-Based Auto:** Recenter, Exhale, Mantra, Ground
- **Timed Amplifier:** Affirm
- **Reactive Defense:** Reflect, Release

### Scaling Philosophy

All abilities scale linearly with level upgrades, maintaining balance while providing meaningful progression. The watercolor aesthetic ensures visual coherence regardless of power level.

### Visual Coherence

Every ability contributes to the unified watercolor canvas. No ability should feel "digital" or out of place — all effects should appear to be painted onto the same paper surface.

## 1. Breathe

* **Type:** Automatic, always active
* **Description:** A constant area of calm that gently damages and slows nearby stressors, pulsing with the rhythm of breathing.
* **Activation:** Always active
* **Base Stats (Agnostic):**
  * Damage: 5 DPS (base), scales with upgrades
  * Slow: 50% slow (0.5x speed multiplier) applied while in AoE
  * AoE Radius: Pulses between 100-140px (player radius + buffer + growth)
  * Cycle Duration: 8 seconds (inhale + exhale)
  * Scaling: Linear (+10% per level damage, +5% per level radius)
* **Mechanics:**
  * **Offensive:** Applies steady, continuous damage to all stressors in range (5 DPS base).
  * **Debuff:** Applies 50% slow to all stressors within the AoE radius (keeps them in range longer).
  * **Pulsing AoE:** Radius expands and contracts with breathing cycle — larger during exhale, smaller during inhale.
  * **Slow Behavior:** Slow persists while stressors are in range; clears when they leave the AoE.
  * **Affirm Interaction:** Slow strength is enhanced by Affirm amplification (stronger Affirm = stronger slow).
  * Serves as the game's stable "heartbeat" and primary defensive mechanism.
* **Visual Expression:**
  * A **soft circular bloom** of dye expands and contracts in rhythm with breathing, like a drop of color diffusing in water.
  * Colors shift gently between lavender, amber, and cerulean depending on Serenity, flowing like currents in liquid.
  * Dye feathers at the edges through fluid diffusion; concentration gradients create subtle halos as the liquid flows.
  * The entire scene subtly pulses — the liquid medium "breathes" with gentle currents.
  * Stressors within the bloom appear to move slower, their dye trails becoming more concentrated as they're caught in the calming current.
* **Liquid Techniques:** *Fluid diffusion, radial dispersion, dye concentration gradients, rhythmic flow patterns, current resistance.*
* **Self-Care Alignment:** Continuous breathwork creates a space of calm that slows and transforms stressors — the foundation of all self-care practices. The slow effect represents how focused breathing helps us respond thoughtfully rather than react impulsively.

## 2. Recenter

* **Type:** Automatic, cooldown-based pulse
* **Description:** A grounding ripple that slows approaching stressors and restores calm.
* **Activation:** Every few seconds (moderate cooldown)
* **Base Stats (Agnostic):**
  * Pulse Radius: Expands outward from the center
  * Slow Strength: High (moderate to strong debuff)
  * Serenity Restore: +2 Serenity per pulse (base)
  * Duration: Short pulse (a few seconds)
  * Scaling: +5% radius per level, +0.05 slow strength per level, +0.5 Serenity per pulse per level
* **Mechanics:**
  * **Debuff:** Expanding pulse slows all stressors it touches (persistent slow until target dies).
  * **Non-offensive:** Restores Serenity when pulse expands (instant restoration on activation).
  * **Debuff (enhanced):** Slowed stressors deal 20% less Serenity damage on contact (scales with level).
  * Upgrade scaling increases radius, slow potency, Serenity restoration, and damage reduction.
* **Visual Expression:**
  * A **droplet of dye released into liquid**, creating expanding ripples that propagate outward as translucent waves.
  * Edges branch unpredictably through fluid turbulence — liquid "blooms" forming complex flow patterns.
  * The ripple stirs and mixes with existing dye layers, creating brighter concentrations where currents converge.
  * When it restores Serenity, a gentle upward flow of lighter dye appears at the center.
  * Under Affirm, the ripple becomes a golden current that flows seamlessly into the surrounding liquid medium.
* **Liquid Techniques:** *Fluid turbulence, ripple propagation, dye mixing through convection, soft flow boundaries.*
* **Self-Care Alignment:** Grounding techniques restore emotional balance and reduce the impact of stressors — returning to the present moment.

  * Triggers automatically on cooldown.
* **Visual Expression:**
  * A **golden current** floods through the liquid medium, unifying all dye layers through fluid mixing.
  * The world's hues blend softly into warmer tones as currents carry colors together; boundaries dissolve into harmonious flow.
  * As the current subsides, faint traces remain where dye concentrations once gathered, slowly dispersing through diffusion.
  * The liquid medium appears slightly deeper, indicating increased capacity.
* **Liquid Techniques:** *Current-driven mixing, transparency through fluid depth, dye dispersion, warm color flow.*
* **Self-Care Alignment:** Positive affirmations build emotional capacity and amplify the effectiveness of all other self-care practices — a force multiplier for resilience.

* **Mechanics:**
  * **Offensive:** Emits concentric waves from the center that damage stressors (burst damage per ring).
  * **Debuff:** Waves briefly slow stressors (light slow, stacks with other slows).
  * **Non-offensive:** Restores Serenity on activation (instant restoration).
  * **Debuff (enhanced):** Slowed stressors take +25% increased damage from next Breathe tick (vulnerability debuff).
  * Each ring travels outward and fades at distance.
  * Early activation if Serenity falls below 50% (more frequent recovery when needed).
* **Visual Expression:**
  * **Dye blooms** erupt from the center in successive translucent rings, like ripples from multiple drops.
  * Each ring begins concentrated, then diffuses outward through the liquid into faint halos as dye spreads.
  * Dye concentrations separate into swirling patterns through fluid dynamics; edges fade as they mix with surrounding liquid.
  * The effect looks like concentrated dye being carried outward by flowing currents, gradually diluting.
  * When Serenity is restored, a brief upward surge of lighter dye appears at the center.
* **Liquid Techniques:** *Concentric wave propagation, radial dye dispersion, fluid turbulence patterns, concentration gradients.*
* **Self-Care Alignment:** Intentional breath release reduces stress and restores energy — the exhalation phase of breathwork practice.

  * **Non-offensive:** Provides Serenity regeneration while active (passive recovery during protection).
  * **Defensive (enhanced):** Barrier strength scales with current Serenity (stronger when calmer — up to 50% damage reduction).
  * **Buff (self):** Reduces incoming Serenity damage by percentage while active.
* **Visual Expression:**
  * A **layer of clear liquid** forms a protective dome, shimmering with faint dye reflections from the fluid below.
  * When stressors touch it, their dye colors **flow backward** — mirrored currents that diffuse into the barrier.
  * The dome subtly shifts hue, absorbing and mixing with the colors of those who struck it through fluid exchange.
  * When it dissipates, it leaves behind a pale concentration ring where the liquid layer once separated.
  * The barrier appears thicker and more opaque when Serenity is higher, indicating stronger protection.
* **Liquid Techniques:** *Liquid layer separation, dye backflow through diffusion, color absorption, concentration boundaries.*
* **Self-Care Alignment:** Healthy boundaries protect energy and prevent depletion — saying no to protect your well-being.

  * **Debuff (enhanced):** Channeled target moves 20% slower (focus weakens their movement).
  * Transfers to another target if the first dies mid-channel.
* **Visual Expression:**
  * A **focused stream of dye** flows from center to target, like a concentrated current through liquid.
  * Edges diffuse slightly through fluid flow; dye concentrates at the contact point where the stream meets resistance.
  * The stream fades unevenly as dye disperses through the liquid, leaving a ghost trail where concentration remains.
  * The target appears more transparent and fragile, indicating vulnerability.
  * Under Affirm, the stream glows faintly, as though carrying luminous particles through the liquid medium.
* **Liquid Techniques:** *Focused flow streams, dye concentration at impact, dispersion trails, particle advection.*
* **Self-Care Alignment:** Mantra meditation restores mental energy while dissolving specific stressors — focused attention practice.

  * Only one active field at a time.
* **Visual Expression:**
  * A **spreading dye cloud** blooms outward through the liquid, darkest at its center where concentration is highest.
  * Dye gathers and concentrates through fluid dynamics, forming a soft-edged zone of calm where flow slows.
  * Stressors within appear blurred, their edges softened by the opacity of concentrated dye in the liquid medium.
  * When it fades, it leaves behind a faint discolored region where dye concentration slowly disperses through diffusion.
  * The field pulses gently, indicating the restorative energy it provides.
* **Liquid Techniques:** *Radial dye cloud expansion, concentration through flow patterns, opacity through depth, slow dispersion.*
* **Self-Care Alignment:** Grounding creates a safe, restorative space — a sanctuary where you can recover and recharge.

### Scaling Philosophy

All abilities scale linearly with level upgrades, maintaining balance while providing meaningful progression. Each ability improves in multiple dimensions:

* Offensive abilities: Damage + utility (regen/debuff)
* Defensive abilities: Protection + recovery + counter-attack
* Buff abilities: Amplification + self-enhancement
* Debuff abilities: Control + damage reduction + vulnerability
* Non-offensive abilities: Recovery + capacity building

The liquid watermedia aesthetic ensures visual coherence regardless of power level.

### Visual Coherence

Every ability contributes to the unified liquid medium. No ability should feel "digital" or out of place — all effects should appear to flow through the same fluid medium, interacting through natural liquid dynamics.

### Self-Care Integration

Each ability represents a real-world self-care practice:

* **Breathe** = Continuous breathwork
* **Recenter** = Grounding techniques
* **Affirm** = Positive affirmations
* **Exhale** = Intentional breath release
* **Reflect** = Boundary setting
* **Mantra** = Mantra meditation
* **Ground** = Creating safe spaces
* **Release** = Letting go practices
* **Align** = Work-life balance

All mechanics support both active stress management and passive recovery, reflecting the dual nature of self-care: proactive protection and reactive healing.

# 🌊 Stressors Overview (Liquid Watercolor Expression)

> The battlefield is a fluid medium, and stress flows through it like dye in water.
> Each stressor is both a challenge and a current — color, movement, and pressure in motion through liquid.
> They approach not as enemies to destroy, but as forces to understand, redirect, and transform.

## 1. Intrusive Thought

* **Type:** Direct movement, baseline
* **Description:** Unwanted, persistent thoughts that disrupt focus and flow toward the center like gentle but insistent currents.
* **Unlocks:** Wave 1 (always available)
* **Base Stats:**
  * Speed: 1.0x (baseline reference speed)
  * Health: 1.0x (baseline reference health)
  * Movement: Direct path toward center
  * Special: None (foundational stressor)
* **Mechanics:**
  * **Movement:** Moves directly toward center with consistent velocity.
  * **Behavior:** No special mechanics — serves as the baseline enemy type.
  * **Visual Feedback:** Subtle pulsing when being observed non-judgmentally (affected by Mantra).
  * **Color Response:** Lightens slightly when affected by focused attention abilities.
* **Visual Expression:**
  * Appears as a **soft, cloud-like dye bloom** diffusing through the liquid medium.
  * No sharp edges — boundaries feather naturally through fluid diffusion, like watercolor wash.
  * Subtle pulsing creates gentle expansion/contraction, like a thought being observed without judgment.
  * Colors shift based on Serenity: Light Steel Blue (high) → Pale Blue-Gray (medium) → Slate Gray-Blue (low) → Dark Slate (critical).
  * When affected by Mantra, the dye lightens and becomes more transparent, indicating dissolution through focused attention.
  * Mixes naturally with Breathe dye (Lavender/Pale Blue), creating soft blue-lavender blends through fluid mixing.
* **Liquid Techniques:** *Soft diffusion, radial dispersion, gentle concentration gradients, translucent cloud formation.*
* **Self-Care Alignment:** Intrusive thoughts are universal mental challenges — recognizing them without judgment is the foundation of mindfulness practice. They teach us that thoughts are temporary currents in the mind, not permanent structures.

  * Movement: Direct path with forward momentum
  * Special: Gains 10% speed boost when Serenity < 50%
* **Mechanics:**
  * **Movement:** Moves directly toward center at high speed.
  * **Speed Boost:** When Serenity falls below 50%, urgency increases — speed multiplier increases by 10%.
  * **Fragility:** Lowest health pool — can be managed quickly but requires timely response.
  * **Visual Feedback:** Speed trails intensify with acceleration, creating visible motion streaks in the liquid.
* **Visual Expression:**
  * Appears as a **fast-flowing dye current** with visible motion trails indicating urgency.
  * Sharp, angular appearance (but still soft-edged through fluid) — like ink dropped into moving water.
  * Pulsing rhythm increases with proximity to center, creating visual urgency.
  * Leaves brief trail of dye diffusion, showing the path of urgency through the liquid medium.
  * Colors shift: Warm Ochre (high) → Coral (medium) → Tomato Red (low) → Deep Coral (critical).
  * Speed boost creates brighter, hotter dye color — temperature increases with velocity.
  * Mixes with Recenter dye (Blue-Green) to create warm gray-green, neutralizing urgency through grounding.
* **Liquid Techniques:** *Rapid diffusion, thin viscosity flow, high temperature dye, motion trail formation.*
* **Self-Care Alignment:** Time pressure teaches us that urgency is often self-imposed — grounding techniques and boundaries help us slow down and respond thoughtfully rather than react impulsively.

  * **Visual Feedback:** Unstable, shimmering appearance with visible wobble-induced turbulence.
* **Visual Expression:**
  * Appears as **unstable, shimmering dye** with wobble-induced turbulence patterns.
  * Wobble creates visual "static" through fluid turbulence — like dye disturbed by chaotic currents.
  * Multiple stressors create interference patterns where dye concentrations overlap and amplify.
  * Appears fragmented, like dye disturbed by turbulence rather than smooth flow.
  * Edges blur and reform through wobble motion, creating dynamic, unstable boundaries.

* **Visual Expression:**
  * Appears as **solid, weighty dye** with higher viscosity — like concentrated watercolor pigment.
  * Visual "pressure gauge" fills during orbit — dye concentration visibly increases, creating darker, denser appearance.
  * Dash creates brief streak effect — rapid dye trail showing sudden acceleration.
  * Moves slowly but persistently during orbit — thick dye flow indicating heavy pressure.
  * Mixes with surrounding dye during orbit, showing pressure buildup through fluid exchange.
  * Colors shift: Light Pink (high) → Coral Red (medium) → Deep Coral (low) → Dark Red (critical).
  * Mixes with Reflect dye (Clear Blue) to create muted purple — boundaries deflect expectations.
  * Mixes with Affirm dye (Gold) to create warm orange-gold — self-compassion reduces pressure.
* **Liquid Techniques:** *Slow diffusion, thick viscosity, pressure gradient formation, rapid streak trails.*
* **Self-Care Alignment:** Expectations create pressure through buildup — setting boundaries, practicing self-compassion, and letting go of unrealistic standards help us manage these pressures before they overwhelm us.

  * Creates subtle darkening effect in nearby area — exhaustion aura visible as dye clouding the liquid medium.
  * Multiple Fatigue stressors stack darkness — dye concentration increases, creating denser, darker zones.
  * Appears stagnant, like thick mud in water — minimal diffusion, reduced flow.
  * Colors shift: Slate Gray (high) → Dark Slate Gray (medium) → Dark Gray-Blue (low) → Dull Indigo (critical).
  * Mixes with Ground dye (Brown-Green) to create dark brown-gray — restorative space counters exhaustion.
  * Mixes with Release dye (Turbulent Mix) to create lighter gray — complete recovery clears fatigue.
* **Liquid Techniques:** *Slow diffusion, very thick viscosity, heavy dye concentration, stagnant zone formation.*
* **Self-Care Alignment:** Fatigue represents persistent exhaustion — prioritizing rest, creating restorative spaces, and building capacity through self-care practices help us recover and prevent burnout.

## 6. Overwhelm

* **Type:** Direct movement, accelerating
* **Description:** The feeling of being overwhelmed by too many demands — accelerates based on low Serenity and nearby stressors, creating chaotic, fast-accelerating dye storms.
* **Unlocks:** Wave 13
* **Base Stats:**
  * Speed: 1.2x (moderately fast baseline, accelerates)
  * Health: 0.9x (moderate-low durability)
  * Movement: Direct path with acceleration
  * Special: Acceleration based on Serenity and nearby stressor count (cascade effect)
* **Mechanics:**
  * **Acceleration:** Speed increases based on formula: `1 + (1 - serenity/100) * 1.5 + (nearbyStressors * 0.1)`.
  * **Cascade Effect:** Each nearby stressor (within 200px) adds 10% acceleration — overwhelm escalates with chaos.
  * **Max Speed:** Capped at 2.5x base speed to prevent excessive velocity.

## Design Notes

### Wave Progression

Stressors unlock progressively to teach increasingly complex stress management:

* **Waves 1-3:** Intrusive Thought only — Learn basics with foundational stressor
* **Waves 4-5:** + Time Pressure — Introduce urgency mechanic
* **Waves 6-8:** + Environmental Noise — Add distraction/wobble pattern
* **Waves 9-10:** + Expectation — Introduce orbit/dash pattern
* **Waves 11:** + Fatigue — Add tanky, persistent enemy
* **Waves 12:** + Self-Doubt — Introduce ability debuff mechanic
* **Waves 13-14:** + Overwhelm — Add acceleration/cascade mechanic
* **Wave 15+:** All 7 types — Full complexity, all mechanics active

### Movement Patterns

**By Movement Type:**

* **Direct:** Intrusive Thought, Time Pressure, Fatigue, Overwhelm (4 stressors)
* **Wobble:** Environmental Noise (1 stressor)
* **Orbit/Dash:** Expectation (1 stressor)
* **Erratic:** Self-Doubt (1 stressor)

**By Speed Category:**

* **Fast (1.2x+):** Time Pressure (1.8x), Overwhelm (1.2x+ accelerating)
* **Baseline (0.8x-1.0x):** Intrusive Thought (1.0x), Self-Doubt (0.8x)
* **Slow (0.4x-0.6x):** Environmental Noise (0.9x), Expectation (0.6x), Fatigue (0.4x)

**By Health Category:**

* **Fragile (0.7x-0.9x):** Time Pressure (0.7x), Overwhelm (0.9x)
* **Baseline (1.0x-1.1x):** Intrusive Thought (1.0x), Self-Doubt (1.1x)
* **Tanky (1.2x+):** Environmental Noise (0.8x), Expectation (1.2x), Fatigue (2.0x)

### Color System

All stressors use Serenity-based color interpolation with 4 variants:

* **High Serenity (80-100%):** Lighter, more translucent colors — stressors appear less threatening
* **Medium Serenity (50-79%):** Moderate colors — visible but manageable
* **Low Serenity (20-49%):** Darker, denser colors — stressors appear more intense
* **Critical Serenity (≤19%):** Nearly opaque, stagnant colors — stressors appear overwhelming

Colors blend naturally with ability dyes through fluid mixing, creating intermediate hues that reflect the interaction between stress and self-care practices.

### Special Mechanics Distribution

**By Special Mechanic:**

* **Speed Modifiers:** Time Pressure (speed boost at low Serenity), Overwhelm (acceleration)
* **Amplification:** Environmental Noise (wobble amplification), Overwhelm (cascade effect)
* **Resistance:** Fatigue (aura resistance)
* **Debuffs:** Fatigue (exhaustion aura), Self-Doubt (self-sabotage aura)
* **Vulnerability:** Self-Doubt (2x damage from Affirm)
* **Pattern Movement:** Expectation (orbit/dash), Self-Doubt (erratic/retreat)

### Visual Coherence

Every stressor contributes to the unified liquid medium. No stressor should feel "digital" or out of place — all effects should appear to flow through the same fluid medium, interacting through natural liquid dynamics:

* **Soft Edges:** All stressors use fluid diffusion for boundaries — no sharp outlines
* **Natural Mixing:** Colors blend additively when overlapping — no color replacement
* **Flow-Based Motion:** Movement creates dye trails — speed affects diffusion rate
* **Serenity Response:** Visual state reflects emotional state — high Serenity = smooth flow, low Serenity = stagnant

### Self-Care Integration

Each stressor represents a real-world mental health challenge aligned with 2025 self-care practices:

* **Intrusive Thought** = Unwanted thoughts (mindfulness/meditation)
* **Time Pressure** = Urgency and deadlines (time management/boundaries)
* **Environmental Noise** = Distractions and sensory overload (digital detox/quiet spaces)
* **Expectation** = Internal/external pressures (boundary setting/self-compassion)
* **Fatigue** = Physical and mental exhaustion (rest/sleep/restorative spaces)
* **Overwhelm** = Too many demands (grounding/complete release)
* **Self-Doubt** = Negative self-talk (positive affirmations/focused attention)

All mechanics teach stress management through gameplay — players learn to recognize, understand, and transform stressors using evidence-based self-care practices represented by abilities.

### Ability-Stressor Interactions

**Strong Counters:**

* **Intrusive Thought:** Breathe, Mantra, Recenter, Exhale
* **Time Pressure:** Recenter, Reflect, Align, Ground
* **Environmental Noise:** Ground, Mantra, Recenter, Breathe
* **Expectation:** Reflect, Affirm, Release, Ground
* **Fatigue:** Ground, Release, Align, Affirm
* **Self-Doubt:** Affirm (2x damage), Mantra, Reflect, Release
* **Overwhelm:** Recenter, Release, Ground, Mantra, Exhale

**Color Mixing Examples:**

* Intrusive Thought + Breathe = Soft blue-lavender blend
* Time Pressure + Recenter = Warm gray-green (neutralizes urgency)
* Environmental Noise + Ground = Muted purple-brown (quiets noise)
* Expectation + Affirm = Warm orange-gold (self-compassion)
* Fatigue + Release = Lighter gray (recovery)
* Self-Doubt + Affirm = Bright gold-gray (positive self-talk)
* Overwhelm + Recenter = Muted gray (grounding breaks cycle)

The liquid watercolor aesthetic ensures visual coherence regardless of stressor type or ability interaction — all effects flow through the same fluid medium, creating a unified, therapeutic visual experience.
